## No Pain, No Gain? Not Yet.

Exercise raises heart rate and blood pressure. High blood pressure can literally "pop" grafts out of their channels in the first few days.

### The Gym Timeline
*   **Week 1**: Couch potato mode. Short, slow walks only.
*   **Week 2**: Light cardio (elliptical, walking). No heavy sweating.
*   **Week 4**: Heavy weights and running.
*   **Week 6**: Contact sports (Basketball, MMA, Football).

Sweat contains bacteria and salt, which can irritate the healing scalp. If you do sweat, shower immediately with lukewarm water.
