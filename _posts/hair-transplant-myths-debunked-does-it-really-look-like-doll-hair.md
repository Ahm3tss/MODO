## 1990 vs. 2026

The "Doll Hair" look—plugs of corn-row style hair—is a relic of the old punch graft technique.

### Myth 1: It looks fake.
**Fact**: Modern FUE uses single-hair grafts for the hairline. It is microscopically indistinguishable from nature.

### Myth 2: It's permanent immediately.
**Fact**: The transplanted hair falls out after 3 weeks (Shock Loss) and regrows permanently after 3 months. Patience is required.

### Myth 3: You can use someone else's hair.
**Fact**: This would be an organ transplant. Your body would reject it. You must be your own donor.

### Myth 4: Older men can't get it.
**Fact**: We have successfully treated patients in their 70s. Health matters more than age.
