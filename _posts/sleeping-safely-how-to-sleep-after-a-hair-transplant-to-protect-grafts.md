## Gravity Wars

For the first 5 nights, your sleeping position decides your swelling level and graft safety.

### The Position
*   **Sem-Upright (45 degrees)**: Use two big pillows or sleep in a recliner chair.
*   **Neck Support**: Use a travel neck pillow to prevent your head from rolling side-to-side.

### Why?
1.  **Swelling**: Fluids drain down and out, rather than pooling in your eyes/face.
2.  **Protection**: Prevents you from rubbing the recipient area against the pillow, which can pull out grafts.

After Night 6, you can return to a normal pillow, but stick to sleeping on your back until Day 14.
