## The Two-Stage Strategy

For advanced hair loss (Norwood 5-6), one session cannot cover everything with high density.

### The Strategy
*   **Session 1**: Restore the hairline and mid-scalp.
*   **Session 2 (1 year later)**: Restore the crown (vertex) and add density to the front if needed.

Waiting 1 year allows the donor area to heal fully and the blood supply to completely recover, ensuring high survival rates for the second round.
