## The Trust Process

You leave the clinic looking great with a new hairline. Then, 3 weeks later, it all falls out. Panic sets in.

### Relax. It's Normal.
This is called **Shock Loss**. The trauma of surgery forces hair follicles into the *Telogen* (resting) phase. The hair shaft sheds, but the **bulb** (root) remains safe under the skin.

### The Timeline
*   **Weeks 3-6**: Shedding phase. You might look like you did before surgery.
*   **Months 1-3**: The "Ugly Duckling" phase. Redness, patchy growth.
*   **Month 4**: The Rebirth. Fine hairs start poking through.

Don't judge your result until month 6 minimum!
