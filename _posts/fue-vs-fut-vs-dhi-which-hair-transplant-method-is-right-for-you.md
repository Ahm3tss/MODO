## Understanding the Alphabet Soup

FUE, FUT, DHI—the acronyms can be confusing. Here is the definitive breakdown.

### FUT (Follicular Unit Transplantation)
*   **The Strip Method**: A strip of skin is removed from the back of the head.
*   **Pros**: High graft yield in one session. Cheaper.
*   **Cons**: Leaves a linear scar. Longer recovery.
*   **Verdict**: Mostly outdated, but useful for extreme hair loss cases.

### FUE (Follicular Unit Extraction)
*   **The Standard**: Individual follicles are extracted and canals are opened before implantation.
*   **Pros**: No linear scar. Faster healing.
*   **Cons**: Requires shaving the head.

### DHI (Direct Hair Implantation)
*   **The Gold Standard**: Uses a Choi Pen to implant directly without pre-opening canals.
*   **Pros**: Highest density. No need to shave the recipient area.
*   **Cons**: More expensive. Takes longer.

### Which is Best?
For most MODO patients seeking density and precision, **DHI** or **Sapphire FUE** are the protocols of choice.
