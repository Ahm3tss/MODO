## The Capital of Hair

Istanbul is the Silicon Valley of hair restoration. But with 500+ clinics, quality varies.

### Safety Checklist
1.  **Hospital Setting**: Ensure the surgery takes place in a JCI-accredited hospital, not a flat or office.
2.  **Surgeon Involvement**: Will the doctor make the incisions, or just technicians? At MODO, doctors lead the surgery.
3.  **Reviews**: Look for video testimonials, not just text reviews which can be faked.
4.  **Certifications**: Look for ISHRS or ABHRS memberships.

Turkey is extremely safe for medical tourists if you choose a licensed, reputable provider.
