## Gentle Hands Only

The grafts are loosely held by fibrin clots for the first few days. One wrong scrub can dislodge them.

### Days 1-2
Detailed wash performed by nurses at the clinic.

### Days 3-9: Home Washing
1.  **Lotion**: Apply the softening foam/lotion. Wait 45 mins. Rinse gently with a cup (NO shower head pressure).
2.  **Shampoo**: Foam up shampoo in hands. Pat gently onto grafts. Do NOT rub.
3.  **Rinse**: Gentle rinse.
4.  **Dry**: Paper towel. Pat dry.

### Day 10: The Scab Removal
Now you can rub. Using circular motions, massage the softened scabs away. Your scalp should be clean and pink after this.
