## It's Easier Than You Think

Fear of pain is the #1 reason men delay their transplant. But modern technology has changed the game.

### The Only "Ouch" Moment

The only discomfort happens during the administration of local anesthesia. This takes about 3-5 minutes.
*   **Needle-Free Injection**: We use pressure-jet technology to numb the skin without a needle pricking you.
*   **Vibration**: Distraction devices reduce the sensation.

### During the Surgery

Once the scalp is numb, you feel **nothing**.
*   You can watch movies.
*   You can sleep.
*   You can chat with the medical team.

### Post-Op Discomfort

For 2-3 days after, you might feel a tight sensation or mild throbbing, easily managed with basic painkillers like Paracetamol.
