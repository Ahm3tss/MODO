## The Challenge of the Curl

Afro-textured hair is unique. The curl isn't just visible on top; the root itself curls like a hook beneath the skin.

### Why Standard FUE Fails
A standard straight FUE punch can slice right through the curved root (transection), killing the graft.

### The Specialized Approach
1.  **Wider Punches**: We use slightly larger diameter punches (0.9mm - 1.0mm) to accommodate the curl.
2.  **Manual Punch**: Motorized drills can be too fast. Hand-held manual oscillation allows the surgeon to "feel" the curl.
3.  **Test Extraction**: We always start with a test of 10-20 grafts to determine the subsurface curvature.

When done correctly, Afro hair transplants offer amazing coverage because the curl provides superior volume.
