## Styling Freedom

The best part of a transplant is treating it like real hair—because it IS real hair.

### Haircuts
*   **Day 15**: Scissor cut only on the sides.
*   **Month 1**: Scissor cut on top.
*   **Month 3**: Clippers/Buzz cut allowed on donor area.
*   **Month 6**: Clippers allowed on recipient area.

### Dye and Chemicals
Chemicals are harsh. Wait **6 weeks** before dyeing your hair. The scalp skin needs to be fully healed and desensitized.
