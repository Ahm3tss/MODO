## The Age Dilemma

"Am I too young?" is one of the most common questions we hear at MODO Clinic. While losing hair in your early 20s can be devastating, rushing into surgery isn't always the best answer.

### The Problem with Early Intervention

If you are 21 years old and receding, your hair loss pattern has not yet stabilized.
*   **Shock Loss Risk**: Surgery can accelerate the shedding of unstable native hair.
*   **Future Planning**: If you use up your donor hair now to fix a small recession, you might not have enough left when your crown thins in your 30s.

### The Ideal Age Range

Generally, the sweet spot for a first transplant is **27 to 35**. By this age, the pattern of baldness usually reveals itself fully, allowing surgeons to design a hairline that will look natural for the rest of your life.

### What If I'm Under 25?

If you are young, the focus should be on **stabilization**.
1.  **Medication**: Finasteride and Minoxidil can halt further loss.
2.  **PRP Therapy**: To strengthen existing follicles.
3.  **Conservative Design**: If surgery is performed, we stick to a mature hairline design rather than a low, aggressive one.
