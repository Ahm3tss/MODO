## The Art of the Frame

A hairline defines your face. If it looks fake, the whole surgery fails.

### Rules of Natural Design
1.  **Macro-Irregularity**: The hairline should not be a ruler-straight line. It should have gentle waves zig-zagging.
2.  **Micro-Irregularity**: Single hairs act as sentinels in front of the denser line to create a soft transition.
3.  **Facial Muscle Rule**: The hairline must never be placed on the forehead muscles (frontalis), or it will move when you talk.

We design hairlines based on your Golden Ratio facial proportions.
