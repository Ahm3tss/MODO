## Man vs. Machine

Robotic systems like ARTAS have entered the field. But are they better?

### The Case for Robots
*   **Stamina**: Robots don't get tired or shaky after 6 hours.
*   **Precision**: They can analyze hair angles with mathematical perfection.
*   **Mapping**: AI avoids over-harvesting by randomly selecting grafts.

### The Case for Humans
*   **Artistry**: Hairlines are organic, not geometric. A human eye is often better at creating "perfect imperfections."
*   **Adaptability**: Humans adjust instantly to changes in skin texture or bleeding.

### The Hybrid Approach
The best results come from **Surgeon-Guided Robotics**. Using AI for analysis and extraction, but human hands for the artistic implantation.
