## Price vs. Value

A hair transplant in the US or UK typically costs **$10,000 - $20,000**. In Turkey, it ranges from **$2,500 - $5,000**.

### Why the difference?
*   **Cost of Living**: Lower labor and operational costs in Istanbul.
*   **Volume**: High competition drives prices down and quality up.

### Hidden Fees to Watch For
When booking, always ask:
1.  **Is the blood test included?**
2.  **Is the aftercare medication kit included?**
3.  **Is the hotel closest to the clinic?**
4.  **Are transfers private or shared?**

At MODO, our price is final. No surprises.
