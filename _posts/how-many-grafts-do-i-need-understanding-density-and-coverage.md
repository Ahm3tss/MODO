## The Numbers Game

A "Graft" is a follicular unit containing 1-4 hairs. The average safe donor area has about 6,000-8,000 lifetime grafts available.

### Norwood Scale Estimates
*   **Norwood 2 (Receding Corners)**: 1,500 - 2,000 grafts.
*   **Norwood 3 (Frontal & Temples)**: 2,500 - 3,000 grafts.
*   **Norwood 4 (Front + Crown Start)**: 3,000 - 4,000 grafts.
*   **Norwood 5-6 (Front to Crown)**: 4,000 - 5,500+ grafts (Might need 2 sessions).

### Quality > Quantity
Don't just chase the highest number. Packing 5,000 grafts into a small area can cause necrosis. A good surgeon balances density with safety.
