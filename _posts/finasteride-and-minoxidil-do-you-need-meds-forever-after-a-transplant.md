## Protecting the Investment

A transplant replaces lost hair, but it **does not** stop the genetic process of balding.

### The Native Hair Risk
If you have aggressive hair loss and get a transplant but take no meds, the transplanted hair will stay, but the *native* hair behind it will recede. You will be left with an island of transplanted hair.

### The Strategy
*   **Finasteride**: Stops the loss. Essential for young patients.
*   **Minoxidil**: Boosts thickness.

We generally recommend staying on medication for at least 1 year post-op to maximize density.
