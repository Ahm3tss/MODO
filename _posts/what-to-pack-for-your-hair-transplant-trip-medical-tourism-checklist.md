## Travel Smart

You are going for surgery, not a holiday. Pack accordingly.

### The Essentials
1.  **Button-Up Shirts / Zip Hoodies**: 3-4 pairs. You cannot wear tight-neck t-shirts for 2 weeks.
2.  **Neck Pillow**: The travel kind. This is MANDATORY for sleeping upright for the first 5 nights.
3.  **Slip-on Shoes**: Avoid bending down to tie laces (increases head pressure).
4.  **Hat**: A loose bucket hat (we usually provide one) for the flight home.
5.  **Entertainment**: iPad, Books. You'll have downtime in the hotel.

Leave the hair gel and styling products at home!
