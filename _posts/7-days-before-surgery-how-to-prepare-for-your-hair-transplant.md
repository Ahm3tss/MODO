## The Final Countdown

Surprises in the operating room are bad. Preparation is key.

### 7 Days Out
*   **Stop Blood Thinners**: Avoid Aspirin, Ibuprofen, and multi-vitamins (Vitamin E thins blood).
*   **Stop Alcohol**: Alcohol increases bleeding.
*   **Stop Smoking**: Essential for blood flow.

### 1 Day Out
*   **Sleep**: Get a full 8 hours.
*   **Wash**: Shower and wash your hair thoroughly.
*   **Packing**: Bring a button-up shirt or zip-up hoodie. You cannot pull a t-shirt over your freshly operated head!

### Morning Of
*   **Breakfast**: Eat a hearty breakfast. You need energy for the long day.
*   **Caffeine**: Avoid coffee on the morning of surgery (it raises blood pressure).
