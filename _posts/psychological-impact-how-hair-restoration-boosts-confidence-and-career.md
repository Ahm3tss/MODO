## More Than Just Vanity

Hair loss is often dismissed as cosmetic, but its psychological toll is real.

### The "Aging" Effect
Premature balding can make men look 10-15 years older. Restoring the hairline resets the facial frame, restoring a youthful energy.

### Professional Confidence
Studies show that men with full heads of hair are perceived as more dominant and successful. Many patients report a surge in career confidence post-procedure.

### The Mirror Check
The biggest change isn't how others see you; it's how you see yourself. Stopping the obsession with checking mirrors or hiding under hats is true freedom.
