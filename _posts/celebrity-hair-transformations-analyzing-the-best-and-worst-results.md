## Star Power

Celebrities have normalized hair transplants.

### The Good: Elon Musk
From Norwood 4 to a full head.
*   **Why it works**: High density, conservative hairline height suitable for his age. A textbook success.

### The Good: Wayne Rooney
*   **Why it works**: He started early. He has had multiple FUE surgeries to maintain pace with his natural loss.

### The Controversial: Machine Gun Kelly
*   **The look**: Extremely dense, straight, unnatural hairline.
*   **Verdict**: It fits his punk-rock persona, but for the average professional, it might look too artificial.

Lesson: Choose a style that fits *your* life, not a celebrity's.
