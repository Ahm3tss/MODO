## The Finite Resource

Your donor area (back of head) does not regrow. Once a follicle is moved, it's gone from the back forever.

### Avoiding the "Moth-Eaten" Look
If a clinic takes too many grafts (Over-harvesting), the back of your head will look patchy and see-through.
*   **Safe Limit**: We typically never exceed 4,000 - 4,500 grafts in a single day.
*   **The 1:4 Rule**: Ideally, we leave 3 hairs for every 1 we take.

### Homogenization
A skilled surgeon harvests evenly from the entire safe zone, so the reduction in density is uniform and unnoticeable to the naked eye.
