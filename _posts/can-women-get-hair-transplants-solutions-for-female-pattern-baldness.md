## Breaking the Stigma

Hair loss isn't just a male problem. 40% of women experience visible thinning by age 40.

### Differences in Female Hair Loss
Men recede; women diffuse. Female pattern baldness usually involves overall thinning across the top of the scalp while maintaining the hairline.

### The Approach: Unshaven FUE
Women should almost never have to shave their heads for surgery.
*   **Donor Window**: We shave a small rectangular patch in the back of the head that is completely hidden by your remaining long hair.
*   **Implantation**: We carefully implant between existing long hairs to increase density.

### Forehead Reduction
A common cosmetic request is lowering a naturally high hairline. This is a highly effective procedure that instantly feminizes the face.
