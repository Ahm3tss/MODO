## The Cover-Up

We know you want to hide the surgery signs, but patience is required.

### The Timeline
*   **Days 0-5**: **NO HATS.** The grafts are essentially "glue drying." Any contact will rip them out.
*   **Days 6-14**: **Loose Bucket Hat / Fedora**. Only hard, structured hats that rest on the forehead and don't touch the grafts.
*   **Day 15+**: **Baseball Caps / Beanies**. Once the grafts are anchored (after 2 weeks), you can wear normal caps.
*   **Wool Hats**: Wait 1 month, as wool fibers can snag on new hairs.

Always put the hat on using two hands, stretching it wide to avoid scraping.
