## Clean Living for Better Growth

### Smoking (Nicotine)
*   **The Killer**: Nicotine constricts blood vessels. Tiny new grafts need maximum blood flow to survive. Smoking chokes them.
*   **Rule**: Stop 1 week before, 2 weeks after.

### Alcohol
*   **The Thinner**: Alcohol thins blood, causing more bleeding during surgery (longer surgery time) and more bruising after.
*   **Rule**: Stop 3 days before, 5 days after.

### Caffeine
*   **The Pressure**: Raises blood pressure.
*   **Rule**: Skip coffee on surgery day. Resume the next day.
