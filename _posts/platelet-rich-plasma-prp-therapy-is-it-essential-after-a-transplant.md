## Biological Fertilizer

PRP involves drawing your blood, spinning it to isolate gold-colored platelets, and injecting them into the scalp.

### Is it necessary?
Technically, no. A transplant can grow without it.
**BUT**, studies show PRP significantly improves the outcome.

### Benefits
1.  **Higher Survival Rate**: Increases blood flow to newly implanted grafts.
2.  **Less Shock Loss**: Can reduce the post-op shedding phase.
3.  **Faster Healing**: Growth factors repair tissue inflammation rapidly.

We include a high-concentration PRP session with every MODO transplant.
