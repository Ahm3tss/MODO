## Expanding the Donor Pool

For patients with severe hair loss (Norwood 6-7), the back of the head might not offer enough grafts. Enter **Body Hair Transplantation (BHT)**.

### Beard Hair: The Best Backup
Beard hair is thick, robust, and survives well on the scalp.
*   **Best Use**: Adding density to the crown (vertex) or mixing with scalp hair for the mid-scalp.
*   **Avoid**: Never use beard hair for the soft hairline. It's too coarse.

### Chest Hair
Chest hair is thinner and has a shorter growth cycle.
*   **Best Use**: Only as a last resort for softening harsh transitions.

### Does it look weird?
When mixed properly (e.g., 1 beard hair for every 3 scalp hairs), it blends seamlessly and provides excellent volume.
