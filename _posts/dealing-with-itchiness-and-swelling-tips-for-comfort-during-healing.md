## The Itch Means Healing

Itching is a sign that nerves are regenerating and skin is knitting together. But it can drive you crazy.

### Managing Itch
*   **Saline Spray**: Keep the scalp moist. Spray every 30-60 mins.
*   **Aloe Vera**: Only on the donor area (back).
*   **Don't Scratch**: Tap gently with fingertips.

### Managing Swelling
*   **Ice**: Apply to forehead (not grafts).
*   **Hydrate**: Drink 3L of water.
*   **Massage**: Gently massage the forehead (lymphatic drainage) to push fluid to the ears.
