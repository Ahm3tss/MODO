## Staying Comfortable

We use a dual-layer approach to ensure comfort.

### 1. Mild Sedation (Optional)
For anxious patients, we can offer a mild oral sedative (like Xanax) to help you relax before we start.

### 2. Local Anesthesia
This is the main numbing agent.
*   **Ring Block**: Numbing the nerves around the perimeter of the head.
*   **Tumescence**: Injecting a saline/anesthesia mix under the skin to lift it away from the skull. This makes extraction easier and safer.

Once the anesthesia takes effect (5 mins), the area feels "wooden" and you will feel absolutely no pain sensation, only vibration or touch.
